This add-on allows you to run a grocery in a Bring Your Own Container (BYOC) schema. With this add-on your customers will be able to buy loose goods using their own reusable container. This add-on also enables customers to weight their vegetables and fruits before they checkout. To weight fruit and vegetable before checkout will speed up the checkout and make your customer happier.

The *self service* BYOC scheme has six steps:
    1. The customer weighs her-his pot and sticks the tare barcode onto the pot.
    2. The customer puts loose goods into the labeled pot.
    3. The customer scans the tare barcode. POS saves the tare value.
    4. The customer weighs the pot with loose goods inside. POS computes the price to pay from gross weight and tare weight.
    5. The customer gets a price barcode label indicating the price to pay.
    6. During checkout, the cashier swiftly scans the price barcode label.


This add-on requires you to have a barcode label printer and an electronic scale. Your customers are expected to use this add-on in a self-service way. This add-on adds multiple news screens that are displayed only on the selected POS.

This add-on displays only the products that are meant to be weighted with a scale.

Home screen of the selected POS is:

Usage
=====

Install this add-on and configure the point of sale where you want to use a self service weighting station. The label printing is done using web print. To streamline the label printing it is advised to use the silent printing mode (firefox) or the kiosk printing (chrome).

The command line to start a chrome base browser in kiosk mode with silent printing looks like:

``chromium-browser --use-system-default-printer --kiosk --kiosk-printing http://localhost:8069/``
