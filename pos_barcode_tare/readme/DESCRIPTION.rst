This add-on enable POS to read and print tare barcodes. A tare barcode is used to sell loose goods in a bring your own container (BYOC) scheme.

The BYOC scheme has four steps:
    1. The cashier weights the container and sticks the tare bar code onto the customer's container.
    2. The customer takes the desired quantity of the good s-he wants to buy.
    3. The cashier weights the filled container and good, POS gives the corresponding price.
    4. The cashier scans the tare bar code, POS removes the container's weight from the latest product of the order.

This add-on adds a news screen to POS to (web) print the tare barcode labels. This add-on enables POS to read a tare
barecode. When such a barcode is read, POS adjusts the weight of the latest article in the order list.
The new weight is equal to the total weight minus the tare weight. The price is updated accordingly to the weight
change.
